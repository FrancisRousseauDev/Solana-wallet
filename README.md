## Technologies used

**Type of wallet**: Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet

HD wallets enable a series of key pairs to be created from one random seed, providing convenience and manageability as well as high-level security.

**Mnemonic** phrases to generate key/value pairs

## What is a crypto wallet?

Crypto wallets are one of the foundations of Web 3. They are the gateway application into crypto ecosystems by enabling users to interact with blockchain protocols and manage digital assets.

Under the hood, wallets leverage cryptographic technologies to generate and recover private keys.


## ðŸ’» Running the development server
Start the Next.js development server on the default port 3000 with:

```
yarn dev
```

> Alternatively, run `yarn dev -p 8080` or any port other than `8080` to start the server in a different port.

Once the server is running, you should see output that looks like this:

```
yarn run v1.22.11
$ next dev
ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
info  - Using webpack 5. Reason: Enabled by default https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/webpack5
event - compiled successfully
```

You can now view the running application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
